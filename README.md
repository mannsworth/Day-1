# Day-1
  This is my first day of learning Python with help of a book named 'A Byte of Python' in Russian translation.
In this day I have learned things such like:
1. Comments;
2. Constants;
3. Numbers;
4. Strings;
5. Variables;
6. Identifier names;
7. data types;
8. Objects;
9. logical and physical strings;
10. indentation;
11. Operators and everything connected with them.

I will post my day progress every single day untill I will learn it seriously, so follow me if you want to see my progress.
